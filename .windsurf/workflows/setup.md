# Setup Workflow

This workflow installs all necessary project dependencies using `pnpm`.

1.  Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies from `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
2.  If the command fails, check for errors in the console output.
3.  If successful, confirm that the `node_modules` directory has been created.
