# Commit Workflow

This workflow guides you through creating a standardized Git commit.

1.  Review the staged changes using `git status`.
2.  Ask for a one-sentence summary of the changes.
3.  Based on the summary, generate a commit message following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat: add new login component`).
4.  Ask for confirmation before running `git commit -m "..."`.
