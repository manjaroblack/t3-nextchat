# Test Workflow

This workflow executes the project's test suite.

1.  Run the test command: `pnpm test`.
2.  Analyze the output for any failing tests.
3.  If tests fail, review the error messages and the related source code to identify the issue.
4.  Suggest and apply fixes for the failing tests.
5.  Rerun the tests to confirm the fix.
